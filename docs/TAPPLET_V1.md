# Tapplet V1 product contract

Tapplet is an iPad app for making a small, self-contained classroom applet and
publishing it as one student-facing web link.

The August 2026 pilot targets 10–20 Singapore upper-primary and secondary
teachers. The app performs generation through the Tapplet API, so it does not
depend on Apple Intelligence.

## Product promise

> Make the small interactive applet your next lesson needs, then share one link.

An applet should normally fit one browser viewport and serve one focused
learning purpose. A short linear story may use two or three screens, but Tapplet
is not intended to generate full webpages, dashboards, lessons, menus or
multi-activity labs.

Teachers do not need to start from an empty prompt. They can run and remix a
curated example or answer a short guided interview. Generation uses relevant
published and curated examples as inspiration, and revision always starts from
the current HTML rather than recreating the applet from scratch.

## V1 experience

1. Open **Explore**, **Make** or **My Applets**.
2. Run/remix an example, or answer the guided questions and approve the brief.
3. Generate the applet and interact with it directly in the iPad preview.
4. Ask Tapplet for a change. The working preview remains visible while the new
   revision loads.
5. Restore any earlier revision if the change is not useful.
6. Edit project details such as title, summary, subject, level and tags without
   making a model request.
7. Test the applet full-screen.
8. Publish an unlisted URL, then copy it, show its QR code or use the iPad share
   sheet.
9. Extend or revoke the publication from the originating device.

Explore contains the reviewed HTML seed catalogue bundled with the app. My
Applets stores local project files and synchronises the server-owned revision
history. The editor is preview-first: there is no raw syntax tree or structural
layout editor.

## Artifact contract

The canonical artifact is one complete HTML document with inline CSS and
JavaScript. The model may use browser APIs available in Safari, but generated
artifacts cannot load packages, contact external services, include credentials,
collect student identity or submit student work. Teacher images use relative
`assets/<assetId>` references and are resolved by the iPad preview and public
publication routes.

The service applies deterministic checks before saving a generated revision:

- complete HTML document with `doctype`, `head` and `body`;
- at most 200 KB (the generation prompt targets substantially less);
- no external scripts, styles, packages, frames or arbitrary resource URLs;
- no network APIs;
- only existing images owned by the teacher's device;
- deterministic text moderation;
- one bounded model repair when generated output fails the checks.

The generation prompt asks for a compact, touch-first applet, one coherent
interaction system and simple readable JavaScript. The model returns the full
HTML document plus an optional design card. The card and project metadata help
future revision, retrieval and remixing; failure to parse the optional card does
not discard otherwise valid HTML.

Generated JavaScript runs only in the applet's front end. It has no Tapplet
credentials, cookies or server-side execution path. Student interaction state
is transient browser state.

## System boundary

                       Student Safari
```

The iPad app loads artifact HTML directly into a non-persistent `WKWebView`.
The public URL serves the same immutable source revision directly, with a fixed
report control added by the service. No separate player or proprietary applet
language sits between the artifact and the browser.

The Tapplet API remains separate from the Express/Socket.IO classroom server.
It owns model routing, validation and bounded repair, device credentials,
quotas, images, immutable revision history, publication, expiry, reports and
revocation.

## Storage and revision model

- An **artifact** owns editable metadata and points to one head revision.
- A **revision** is immutable and references content-addressed HTML in R2.
- Revising creates a child revision and atomically moves the head when the
  caller still has the expected prior head.
- Restoring history moves the head pointer; it does not copy or mutate source.
- A **publication** snapshots one revision and keeps its slug when republished.
- A **remix** creates a new artifact and records its source revision.
- Revision-to-image references are stored explicitly for deletion and public
  delivery checks.

Every successful private revision remains in the teacher's history. Global
retrieval contains the reviewed seed corpus and at most one published revision
per teacher artifact. Failed generations and unpublished intermediate
revisions are not globally indexed. Retrieval is a rebuildable projection over
titles, descriptions, subjects, levels, interaction patterns and tags; the HTML
sources remain authoritative.

The reviewed corpus is deployed through the authenticated seed import route.
Configure the Worker secret with `wrangler secret put
STUDIO_SEED_IMPORT_TOKEN`, then import the validated local corpus with:

```bash
STUDIO_SEED_IMPORT_TOKEN=... npm run studio:seeds:import -- \
  --endpoint https://<studio-origin>/v1/seeds
```

The import is idempotent for stable `<seed-id>-seed` revisions, writes each HTML
source to R2 before updating D1 and marks the retrieval row as curated. The
scheduled artifact cleanup excludes curated seeds.

## Supported content

The HTML artifact model supports focused quizzes, matching/sorting/sequencing,
interactive diagrams, classroom utilities, graph explorers, small
simulations, writing tools and other browser-based interactions. These are
authoring and retrieval descriptions, not schema labels that grant special
capabilities.

Larger activities should be split by learning purpose. For example, a
qualitative-analysis catalogue becomes separate one-unknown practice applets;
a simulation should centre on one model with its controls, readouts and graph
rather than several unrelated activities.

V1 supports teacher images through Photos, Files and Camera. Inputs remain
size-limited, normalised, safety-checked and stripped of metadata by the
existing image pipeline before they can be referenced by generated HTML.

## Explicit non-goals

V1 does not provide:

- student accounts, identity, submissions, persistence or analytics;
- student-facing model calls;
- server-side execution of generated code;
- arbitrary packages, external requests, advertising or tracking;
- a generic scene, drawing, physics, particle, action or state-machine DSL;
- raw AST or state-machine authoring;
- automatic conversion of the previous WidgetSpec experiments;
- full laboratory catalogues inside one artifact.

## Verification gates

- The Tapplet API tests cover generation failure with no persisted revision,
  immutable revisions, optimistic head conflicts, remix lineage, publication
  snapshotting, stable republish slugs, expiry, revocation, quotas, reports,
  image ownership and explicit image liveness.
- All curated seeds pass the shared artifact checks and initialise in jsdom.
- Bundled iPad examples are byte-for-byte copies of the canonical corpus.
- Model evaluation measures first-pass validity, one-repair success and whether
  requested interactions/content appear in the artifact.
- Live verification covers generate, revise, restore, image use, publish,
  anonymous Safari delivery, report, extension, revocation and deletion.
- Before pilot release, the physical iPad flow must complete generation,
  revision while preserving the old preview, history restore, image use,
  publication in Safari and revocation.
- Existing web workspaces continue to build and test independently.

This release is a clean pre-launch cutover. Legacy schema drafts and
publications are reset by migration; no conversion or dual renderer is
maintained.
