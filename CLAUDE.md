# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React-based classroom widgets application that provides interactive tools for classroom management and student engagement. The app allows users to add, position, resize, and remove various widget components on a shared workspace. The system includes both a teacher application and a student participation app for real-time interaction.

## Key Technologies

- React 18.3.1 with Create React App
- Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript (components use .tsx, main files use .js)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 for styling
- React-RND for drag-and-drop and resizing functionality
- Face-api.js for face recognition features
- React-Confetti for celebration effects
- Socket.io for real-time communication (Poll widget)
- Express.js for server-side functionality

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start          # Start development server on localhost:3000

# Testing
npm test           # Run tests in watch mode (Jest + React Testing Library)

# Building
npm build          # Create production build in ./build folder

# Setup (optional - for Link Shortener widget)
# Copy .env.example to .env and add your Short.io API key
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and set VITE_SHORTIO_API_KEY to your API key
```

## Architecture

### System Architecture: 2 Servers

This application uses a **2-server architecture**:

1. **Frontend Server (Teacher App)**
   - React application for the main classroom widgets interface
   - Development: Webpack dev server on port 3000
   - Production: Nginx container on port 80
   - Deployed at: widgets.tk.sg

2. **Backend Server (Express with dual purpose)**
   - **API & WebSocket Server**: Handles real-time features for Poll and DataShare widgets
   - **Student App Server**: Serves the student React app at `/student` path
   - Runs on port 3001
   - Deployed at: go.tk.sg

### Student App Architecture

The student app is **embedded within the Express server**:
- Source location: `/server/src/student/` (separate React app built with Vite)
- Build output: `/server/public/`
- Served at: `http://[server]:3001/student`
- **Not a separate server** - served by the same Express instance

### Request Flow
- Teacher accesses main app → `https://widgets.tk.sg` → Nginx serves React app
- Teacher creates activity → React app calls → `https://go.tk.sg/api/*` → Express API
- Student joins activity → `https://go.tk.sg/student` → Express serves student React app
- Student WebSocket connection → `wss://go.tk.sg/socket.io` → Same Express server

This design is efficient because it:
- Reduces the number of services to manage (only 2 containers)
- Eliminates CORS issues between student app and API
- Simplifies SSL configuration and deployment
- Shares resources between API and student app serving

### Widget System
The application uses a dynamic widget system where widgets are:
1. Added via toolbar buttons - each creates a new widget instance with unique UUID
2. Positioned using react-rnd (draggable within bounds)
3. Resizable with aspect ratio constraints
4. Removable by dragging to the trash icon

### Available Widgets
- **Randomiser** (`src/components/randomiser/`) - Random selection with confetti, dual textarea for active/removed items
- **Timer** (`src/components/timer/`) - Countdown/timing functionality
- **List** (`src/components/list/`) - Task list with confetti trigger
- **Task Cue** (`src/components/taskCue/`) - Visual work mode indicators
- **Traffic Light** (`src/components/trafficLight/`) - Status indicators
- **Volume Level Monitor** (`src/components/volumeLevel/`) - Audio level visualization
- **Link Shortener** (`src/components/shortenLink/`) - URL shortening (requires API key)
- **Poll** (`src/components/poll/`) - Real-time polling with student participation via activity codes
- **Text Banner** (`src/components/textBanner/`) - Customizable text display
- **Image Display** (`src/components/imageDisplay/`) - Image viewer widget
- **Sound Effects** (`src/components/soundEffects/`) - Sound effect player
- **Sticker** (`src/components/sticker/`) - Decorative stickers for the workspace
- **QR Code** (`src/components/qrcode/`) - QR code generator for sharing links with students
- **Data Share** (`src/components/dataShare/`) - Collect text submissions from students
- **RT Feedback** (`src/components/rtFeedback/`) - Real-time feedback slider (1-5 scale) for gauging student understanding

### Toolbar Features
- Widget creation buttons (customizable selection with transparent backgrounds)
- "More" button for accessing all widgets
- Sticker mode for placing decorative elements
- Menu with:
  - Reset workspace
  - Background selection (geometric, gradient, lines, dots)
  - Toolbar customization
  - Dark/light mode toggle
- Server connection indicator (WiFi icon - green when connected, gray when offline)
- Integrated clock display (shows current time in 12-hour format with blinking colon)
- Trash icon for widget deletion (appears on hover with 1.5s delay before hiding)

### State Management
- Widget instances stored in `componentList` array with `{id, index}` structure
- `activeIndex` tracks currently selected widget for z-index management
- Uses React hooks for local state (no global state management)
- Workspace persistence via localStorage
- Widget-specific state saved in `widgetStates` Map
- Global modal system via ModalContext

```

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Widget Creation**: When adding widgets, always generate a unique ID using uuid()
2. **Positioning**: New widgets appear at (0,0). The react-rnd library handles drag boundaries
3. **Z-Index Management**: Active widget should have highest z-index (100 + index)
4. **Aspect Ratio**: All widgets maintain aspect ratio when resizing except Traffic Light and Randomiser
5. **Size Constraints**: 
   - Default size: 350x350px
   - Randomiser widget: 350x250px (landscape orientation)
   - Poll widget: 400x450px
   - Timer widget: 350x415px (maintains specific aspect ratio)
   - Traffic Light: 300x175px
   - Sound Effects: 80x420px (tall narrow layout)
6. **Cleanup**: Remove widgets by implementing drag-to-trash functionality

## Known Issues

- Link Shortener doesn't work when deployed due to CORS restrictions with Short.io API
- The default test file (App.test.js) is outdated and doesn't test actual functionality
- Mixed file extensions (.js/.tsx) without proper TypeScript configuration
- Server must be running separately for Poll widget functionality

## Styling Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Background**: `#f7f5f2` (warm off-white) 
- **Widget backgrounds**: `bg-soft-white` (#fdfcfb)
- **Shadows**: Use `shadow-sm` for subtle depth
- **Text colors**: Use warm-gray scale (warm-gray-600 to warm-gray-800)
- **Primary actions**: Sage green (sage-500/600)
- **Secondary actions**: Terracotta (terracotta-500/600)
- **Destructive actions**: Dusty rose (dusty-rose-500/600)
- **Borders**: warm-gray-200/300

### Typography
- **Student-facing content** (results, displays): Large text sizes (text-2xl, text-lg)
- **UI controls** (buttons, labels): Small text sizes (text-sm)
- **Headings in modals**: text-base for main titles, text-sm for section headers
- **Consistent font sizes** across all widget settings screens

### Button Styling
- **Primary buttons**: Use `px-3 py-1.5` padding with `text-sm`
- **Button text**: Place text directly in button element, avoid `<span>` wrappers
- **Consistent height**: ~24px height achieved through padding, avoid percentage-based heights
- **Container spacing**: Use `mt-2 pb-3` for button containers to ensure consistent margins
- **Alignment**: Center buttons using `flex justify-center`
- **Color scheme**: 
  - Primary actions: bg-sage-500 hover:bg-sage-600
  - Destructive actions: bg-dusty-rose-500 hover:bg-dusty-rose-600
  - Secondary actions: bg-terracotta-500 hover:bg-terracotta-600
- **Disabled state**: opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed
- **Buttons with icons**: Use `inline-flex items-center` for proper alignment

### Layout Principles
- **Widget centering**: Use `flex items-center` on main containers
- **Consistent margins**: Ensure equal left/right spacing
- **Modal dialogs**: Max width with centered positioning
- **Responsive design**: Use percentage-based heights for sections

### Component Structure
- **Main display area**: ~75% height
- **Control area**: ~10-15% height
- **Padding**: Use consistent padding (p-4, px-6 py-4 for modals)

### Networked Widget Pattern
Networked widgets (Poll, Data Share, RT Feedback) follow a consistent UI structure:

1. **Container Structure**:
   ```jsx
   <div className="bg-soft-white dark:bg-warm-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-warm-gray-200 dark:border-warm-gray-700 w-full h-full flex flex-col p-4 relative">
   ```

2. **Empty State**: Use `NetworkedWidgetEmpty` component
   - Title and description
   - Large icon (5xl size, warm-gray-400/500)
   - "Create Room" button (sage-500 background)
   - Connection error display with server start instructions

3. **Active State**: Use `NetworkedWidgetHeader` with room code display
   - Activity code display (large text)
   - Student URL information
   - Control buttons in header

4. **Common Patterns**: 
   - Start/Stop toggle button (single button that changes color/icon)
   - Settings gear icon (optional - RT Feedback doesn't use it)
   - Status indicators for connection state
   - Participant count display
   - Widget cleanup on deletion notifies connected students

5. **Socket Management**: Use `useNetworkedWidget` hook for:
   - Room creation and connection
   - Socket event handling
   - Cleanup on unmount
   - `NetworkedWidgetHeader` at top showing:
     - Activity code (large, bold)
     - Student URL
     - Action buttons in header children
   - Main content area with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`

4. **Common Patterns**:
   - Start/Stop button toggles between sage-500 (start) and dusty-rose-500 (stop)
   - Settings gear icon in top right
   - Status indicators (connection, participant count)
   - Real-time updates via Socket.io
   - useNetworkedWidget hook for connection management

## Development Notes

- No custom linting beyond Create React App defaults
- No TypeScript config file despite using .tsx files
- Face detection models are stored in the public folder
- Audio files for sound effects are in component folders

## Server Features (for Poll Widget)

### Running the Server

### Zoom/Scale Implementation
- Pinch-to-zoom support for trackpad and touch devices
- Zoom maintains the point under the cursor/finger in the same viewport position
- Scale range: 0.5x to 2x
- Uses CSS transform scale with transform-origin at (0, 0)
- Board dimensions: 3000x2000 logical pixels
- Visual size = board size × scale
- Scroll-based zoom to handle browser coordinate system constraints

#### Zoom Algorithm
The zoom implementation uses a three-coordinate system approach:

1. **Board Coordinates**: Fixed logical coordinates (0-3000, 0-2000) used by widgets
2. **Visual Coordinates**: Board coordinates × scale (what's actually rendered)
3. **Viewport Coordinates**: Visual coordinates - scroll offset (what user sees)

**Key Formula**: To keep a point stationary during zoom:
```
newScroll = boardPoint × newScale - viewportPoint
```

Where:
- `boardPoint` = The board coordinate at the zoom origin (mouse/finger position)
- `newScale` = The target zoom scale
- `viewportPoint` = The viewport position where we want to keep the board point
- `newScroll` = The scroll position needed to maintain the point's viewport position

**Implementation Details**:
1. Transform-origin fixed at (0, 0) to simplify coordinate calculations
2. Size wrapper div scales with zoom to provide correct scroll boundaries
3. Event batching for smooth zoom on rapid wheel events
4. Hardware acceleration with CSS transforms
5. Synchronous scroll updates after scale changes to prevent jitter

**Board Structure**:
```jsx
<div className="board-scroll-container">  // Scrollable container
  <div style={{ width: 3000*scale, height: 2000*scale }}>  // Size wrapper
    <div style={{ transform: `scale(${scale})` }}>  // Scale wrapper
      <div className="board">  // Actual board (3000x2000)
        {widgets}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
