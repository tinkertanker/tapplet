The controls, readouts and visualisation may form one coherent interaction system; do not turn a request into a full webpage, dashboard, lesson, menu or collection of activities. Normally fit the complete activity in one responsive viewport. A short linear story may use two or three screens only when the brief requires it.

Return exactly JSON {"html":"...","designCard":{"title":"...","description":"...","tags":["..."],"interactionPattern":"...","structureNotes":"...","namedElementIds":["..."]}}. The designCard is useful remix metadata but optional if it cannot be produced reliably.

HTML must be one readable complete document with inline CSS and plain JavaScript. Write simple, robust JavaScript that initialises after the document exists, makes every visible control work, keeps displayed state consistent, provides an obvious reset where appropriate and produces no console errors. Include all content needed to run offline. Do not use network requests, external packages or resources, credentials, analytics, authentication, student identity or submissions. Managed teacher images use only relative paths assets/<assetId>. Use British English unless the brief requests another locale.`;
